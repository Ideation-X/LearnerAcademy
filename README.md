    * then got to your vs-code and one your terminal in vs code
    * then write this command eg: git clone <paste ssh link you copied here>
    * if you face any error then make sure that you have already installed git - To check the command ( git ) in
      terminal of vscode if there is any error then install git first.

    * then click three dots > click Branch >  click Create Branch > Your Branch name should be your name
    * now go to that branch > You will see the main branch on the footer of the vs-code just left in the corner and switch to your branch
    * Write the message by writing your name first like eg: ( shahma : created the sidebar)
    * Now click commit and wait for a few seconds
